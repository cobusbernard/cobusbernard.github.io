      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with multiple AWS accounts for the last few months between various organisations. Logging into each one when I need to make a change quickly became tedious and slow. Each environment (dev, test, staging, production) has their own AWS account. The need to log in stems from taming the infrastructure with Terraform for systems that have been set up by hand and dealing with the discrepancies between them, so I tend to jump between dev and staging very often.</description>

      <description>Everyone who has an SSH port open to the world knows the amount of brute force attempts you will get. It doesnâ€™t matter if you only accept keys, the script kiddies will still try. Easiest fix for this is rate limiting: you can only attempt to login 3 times per 10 minutes. This does not include successful logins, only failed ones. To do this, use the following IPTables commands:&#xA;sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH --rsource sudo iptables -A INPUT -m recent --update --seconds 600 --hitcount 4 --rttl --name SSH --rsource -j DROP sudo iptables-save &amp;gt; /etc/iptables_rules Add the following to /etc/rc.</description>
