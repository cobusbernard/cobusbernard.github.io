Quotes
------
Even profilers have bugs - always measure and confirm.
"The most fertile source of insight is hindsight."
"What gets measured, gets managed." - Peter Drucker
"Stop gut-driven development." - Kenneth Kalmer
"I want someone to look at me like a Ruby developer looks at their code." - @IAmDeveloper
Philomath - A lover of learning.
The need to lean is inevitable focus on the process not just the object of it.
