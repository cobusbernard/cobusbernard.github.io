      <description>One of those djissis duh moments - trying to check out a public git repo, but failing due to authentication &amp;hellip;&#xA;git clone git@github.com:cobusbernard/Scripts.git Cloning into &amp;#39;Scripts&amp;#39;... Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address &amp;#39;192.30.252.131&amp;#39; to the list of known hosts. Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. So I checked my ssh setup / keys, but nothing in there looks dodgy:</description>
