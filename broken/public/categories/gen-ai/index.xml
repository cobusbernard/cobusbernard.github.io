      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been neglecting my blog, and decided it is time to start writing again. So like any good software developer, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually write a post, I start by tinkering with my blog setup. I initially ran it as a Jekyll generated static site on GitHub using GitHub Pages, and then as part of a live-stream, moved it to use AWS Amplify to host it in on of my many AWS accounts.</description>
