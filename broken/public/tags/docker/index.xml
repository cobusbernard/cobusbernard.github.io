      <description>The Problem I woke up this morning wanting to start on a long post about Terraform and how I ended up with the structure shown in my repo. I recently reinstalled my Macbook using Netatalk for a timemachine , and as I fired up my vagrant image, it started to pull down the Ubuntu box first and then started configuring it. This is very useful, but it is slow. And it broke.</description>

      <description>I am currently unable to upgrade to the latest version of Slack due to this bug. That combined with my user profile confusion (originally I set up using a US account, then changed to an South African one) that causes requests to update to versions of iPhoto which aren&amp;rsquo;t available in my region made me decide that it is time for a reformat.&#xA;To create a full backup to my raid&amp;rsquo;ed server, I need to set up netatalk.</description>

      <title>Home VPN with OpenVPN</title>

      <description>Having just set up an external VPN to pretend to be in the US, I wanted one to get into my home network as well when on the road. I ran into the issue while in the USA recently where I was unable to purchase Steam games as their servers picked up that I was in the States, but my payment method was South African. Never thought I would need to spoof my own IP Address to pretend to be in South Africa.</description>

      <title>Personal VPN - OpenVPN in Docker on DigitalOcean</title>

      <description>I was playing around on a random site today, when I received the message This content is not available in your country yet. As a South African, we run into this a lot as our online presence it not that large and most international companies do not feel it is financially viable to run their services here. So I decided it is time to get a VPN going to avoid this.</description>
