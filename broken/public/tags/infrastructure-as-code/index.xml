      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with multiple AWS accounts for the last few months between various organisations. Logging into each one when I need to make a change quickly became tedious and slow. Each environment (dev, test, staging, production) has their own AWS account. The need to log in stems from taming the infrastructure with Terraform for systems that have been set up by hand and dealing with the discrepancies between them, so I tend to jump between dev and staging very often.</description>
