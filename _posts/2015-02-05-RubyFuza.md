**The Joy of Programming**\\
Aaron Patterson - RedHat (Cloud management)

Discussed the joy of daily problem solving and how much fun that is.

--------
**Shattered dreams and broken promises**\\
Kenneth Kalmer

You should not do hope driven development, i.e. "I hope this makes the service faster." Measure everything and make decisions based on concrete data, not feelings.

--------
**Yet Another Technical Intimidation Talk**\\
Jackline Mutua

Getting into tech in Kenya in early 2000s - challenges of getting online access, how friendly the Ruby community was.

--------

**Extending Ruby by Harnessing other Languages**\\
Brendon McLean
Using other languages via Ruby - number crunching of GitHub stats, looking for outlier committers. Using some Lisp concepts to do this.

--------

**I drank the single page app Kool-Aid**\\
Che Nxusani

Mobile devices do not have as much power as desktops. Loading the 50 ~ 100kb of Javascript and then redering it is very slow for the first page. A better way is to load a static landing page, then only load the Javascript framework / SPA and switch over.

--------

**My journey in becoming a polyglot**\\
Theo Bohnmen

What you can learn from different languages, just beware of not learning anything properly. At least try one from each of the paradigms of: procedural, object oriented, functional and set-based.

--------

**How not to rewrite your library: Tips on stable APIs**\\
Loren Segal

Deprecation, doing it properly, 20year old linux app could still compile after only 2 changes. Even when you are gearing up for a major (SemVer) release, try to ensure that your API/methods stay backward compatible. Deprication doesn't mean you **will** remove the method, but rahter that there is something wrong with it and there is now a better way to do it.

--------

**The not so very short migration to Rails 3.0**\\
Grant Speelman

Why it took so long, things to avoid. Issues around maintaining multiple branches, not having enough test coverage.

---------

**Citizen Science with OpenROV**\\
Ray Hightower

Underwater, remote controlled sub, open source code + hardware.

---------

**Mentoring and being mentored - Tips & Tricks**\\
Steven McDonald

Young enough to know everything, if you mentor, make sure you leave your issues outside, it scares the mentees. I.e. if you come to work angry about something, chances are that the mentees will not ask you anything as they are scared of you.

---------

**Over 9000: JRuby in 2015**\\
Charles Nutter

Bringing concurreny to Ruby. C calls from Ruby. Massive speed improvements, but need to make sure the JRuby version of the gem exists.

---------

Garren Smith

Sites need to be accessible to everyone - some countries have laws around this - US / Australia. Blind man sued Sydney over the Olympic site that wasn't accessible to him.
