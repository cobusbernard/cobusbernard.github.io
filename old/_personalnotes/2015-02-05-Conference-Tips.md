Things to bring along:
: * Warm top - the aircon might not be what you like, most likely to be too cold.
 * Converter for you charger - even with a Mac you might need to charge it / help out friendly non-local attending.
 * Something to take notes with - the volume if data coming at you will be vast, you will forget a lot.

Presenter
: * White / black background - depends on lighting. If at all possible, try to test the projector prior to giving the talk.
 * Use humour during the talk - the most fun ones are where the audience laughs and partakes.

 People who attend conferences almost always want to be there and are very friendly. Take the time to start chatting to people you don't know, it is how you will meet others in your field of interest.
