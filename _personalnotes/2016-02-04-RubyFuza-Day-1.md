**Factory, Workshop, Stage**
*[Sarah Mei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei)*

Consulting == working with teams, not on projects. Sits with the team to nudge them into high functioning teams.
Software are people and only incidently code.
Issue is that software processes are viewed as products.
"Shipping code" - hard to call it that when you do it 10x a day
"Maintenance" - just making corrections
"View people as factory workers" - doesn't matter if you have turnover or assholes.
"Productivity" - just count the items coming off the conveyer belt

The factory model not only fails us, it doesn't even match the way of doing things.
Software has changed a lot in the last 15 years, the model we use to build software needs to change.
(Think miasma vs germ theory)
"All models are wrong. Some models are useful." - Georgs E. P. Box
The new model needs to show the human element.

* The hiring problem

* The turnover problem

* The growth problem

* The productivity problem
How do you measure the output?

The workshop model moves the focus from the product to the people. But it doesn't address the growth and productivity problems.

Theatre model
* A script
* The actors
* Read-throughs
* Self-study
* Rehearsal
* Performance

If you give the same problem to different teams, you get different results. Similarly, if you give the same problem to the team twice, you will get 2 different results. Playing Macbeth: as insane, or sane in an insane world. _Theatre isn't asking for metrics_. _Productivity_ is tied to a product - it is in the word. *People are the center of software. Not products.*
Factory: what the rest of the company is doing. At certain scale, you have to think of people as resources to be able to create a direction.
Workshop: how to work as a team when we need to focus on the code.
Stage: How we work together, what a high functioning team looks like.

Toptal article 5 golden rules for API design.

* Documentation
Precise, simple and easy to understand. Documenting the system isn't as important as documenting the API. Generaly have the resource url, with one method to it. Swagger it!

* Stability &B consistency
Provide changelogs for your API. Version it!

* Flexibility
Requirements and understanding are always changing. Make sure it is easy to extend, maintain and scalable.

* Security
