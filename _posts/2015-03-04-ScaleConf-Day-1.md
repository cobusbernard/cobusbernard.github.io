These are just some personal notes, will do a write-up on the entire conference later this week.

**[ScaleConf](scaleconf.org) Intro by Mike ([@imsickofmaps](https://twitter.com/imsickofmaps))**\\
Code of conduct -> **"Don't be a dick!"**

---

**[Robert Elliot](https://twitter.com/greenafrican) from [GraphFlow](http://graphflow.com)**

University didn't really prepare, more learning on the job. Use the free online courses to better yourself [MIT](), [Coursera](), [Udemy](), etc. Should create the yearning for learning - ties back with the polymath concept from RubyFuza. Consulting, started at 5 days a week, took down to 4 to allow retraining / trying out different ideas. Not the classic quit -> startup, slowly built up. South Africa isn't big on the quit concept, hard to get funding. "If you want to start a business, there are plenty of hours between 9PM and 2AM". Very important to ensure you have the MVP down, allows you test the product. Once you have that, it is easier to get investors onboard.

**Thought they were building**\\
Large companies (ecommerce, brick & mortar), large datasets to analyze, needs introduction between products and people. Could be a kettle, songs, items, etc. Sales process took too long - 6~9 months to close a deal.

**Crowd sourcing in 1982**\\
Reduced the time for crossing Atlantic from 3 months down to 1 month. First telegram line due to this. Origin of the data-driven business idea. Knew they wanted to be in the machine prediction learning space. The larger the company, the more like they will want customization. Less of a product, more of service that can be customized - *consultingware*.

Started by getting funding from [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/) and [88mph](http://www.88mph.ac/). Worked out the product with 88mph and WooThemes helped take it to market. The change to  from few, large sources to many, small data sets changed the focus. Wanted to build a scalable company. Investors played a big role in the transition. The business that you get into needs to excite you.

**Incubation**\\
How it shaped you and added value? 88MPH feb 2014 program (2nd incubation program). Helped with the investing - add value by understanding the business and advising on it. (Mxit was using GraphFlow at this point). If you are interested in a product, the best way to test it is to give them $10 ~ 20k for 3 months and see what they can do. Quicker than the standard lawyers / due dilligence / 6-12 month checking. The latter is for more established businesses. GraphFlow had to pivot, not on the idea level, but rather on the business' they were focussing. "Find an investor who has the same short, medium and long term vision as you." Talk to the people at the incubator, ask "why do you want to invest" and "what do you want to get out of this". Spending time with them will allow you to get a feel and ensure that your goals align. Leap of faith, trust instincts and don't be a dick.

**Day-to-day challenges**\\
(Dropping a big release today). Only 2 people, didn't intent to use PHP, changed from Scala. 28 AWS instances, Robert manages 5~6. About 300k events per day. Contributing ~R1M to the companies they serve's bottom line per month. Have about 600 signed up companies. Need to start getting more employees, suppot is increasing, so need to grow to accomodate this. Daily wrangles with [Elasticsearch](). Customers with custom plugins on WooCommerce conflicting with GraphFlow. Head of marketing / cleaning desks - the 2 heads have to wear many hats. Not a lot of time in meetings, but still spent lots of time talking with the customers.

How do you cope with community revolt around pricing changes: helps to work with the team for WooThemes who understand their customers. They have 600k ~ 1.2M installs. They provide a lot of feedback and help with the decisions based on this. They know exactly how much money they make their customers, makes it easier to sell the product as you can quantify the income generated.

**Questions**\\
Computer literacy is badly done. Excel / Word doesn't count. Should be a dialy, part of everyday tasks, not a "take this course".
Business literacy for hardcore techies: generally well-versed in business concepts as they read more overall. Need to recognize technical skills in the same way as management: no reason not to pay the top techie the same a manager. Make them part of the conversation.

Fundraising is difficult, easier as they already had a product that did something to show to investors. Biggest challenge was the amount of time it takes to raise the money. If you need money next week, you probably won't get it - can take up to 6months to get some money from investors. Need to put together proposal, flying to different cities, creating presentations. This takes a lot of time, especially if you are only 2 people. If you think you need the money, rather start pitching for it early. Perception exists that there is a *lack of money* available for investing in tech startups - a lot less than the US.

IP protection: come from South Africa, building the company here, so all IP is inside SA. Plugin is licensed, but no specific IP on software. Currently powering recommendation for "Story".

**[Franz Struwig](fstruwig) from [Garmin](http://www.garmin.co.za/)** (previously [Kubu](http://ikubu.com))

Reaction to bad corporates - wanted to create a space for techies that allow you to be the same person as at home. You spend so much time at work, it should be fun. Started with a micron meter for sheep wool. Original vision was very weak, just hacking things. News refers to "startup" but Kubu was 8 years old when they did the exit. Used [theatre improv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre) to get creative solutions to problems. Got the idea from seeing a guy cycling on the wrong side of the road due to being afraid. Started by consulting and selling services to corporates - wanted to make money and explore ideas at the same time.

Finding funding in 2012 was difficult. Tried locally, [InvenFin](http://invenfin.com/), [Technology Innovation](http://www.tia.org.za/) - took a year to get the contract signed for funds, but still didn't materialize. The effort was more than building the unit. Decided to rather focus on the unit. Needed a big partner to slap their sticker on it - OEM route, they manufacture and use your product. Spoke to people in Japan, but another year later, still nothing. Provided designs / libraries. Realised that no-one will make the same effort to take your product to market. Started to loose the bike-radar first-in-market advantage. Decided to go the crowd-fund route, inspired by Knife Capital (Grindstone program). Had money in the bank, asked what they would do with it - 40% margins, need to double revenue at end of year. Setting the big goals helped move them to get things done. This lead to the crowd-funding: elevates profile internally and also tapping market globally for consulting. Need to somehow get international networking to get your name out there. Exchange rate make it very favourable. The signup process was very good, ensures that you aren't selling snake oil. Lots of community support, after 1 day only 12 units sold. Whole team transformed into marketing - one guy for twitter, one for email, etc. Just ping every possible channel you know of. Incredibly tiring / taxing, need to answers lots of questions, need to remember that it isn't to make money, it is marketing. One of the best things was getting other good people on-board with tasks, i.e a high-quality video. Had to extend the period to try to meet the target. In the process of trying to sell it on a Sunday - one buyer was from Stanford. She ended up showing it to someone at Garmin. [Rain Maker](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/) - bumped into him in the US, did a nice review - everyone at Garmin reads his blog. Also stalked Garmin on LinkedIn, targeted everyone who had done an exit with them in the last few years. They ended up playing with it in Germany - after using it, they became very very interested. Difference about reading about something vs experiencing something.

Needed to make a decision if they wanted to go international: different laws around warranties, RF emissions. Decided to back the last bit of the project themselves - if you don't meet the target, you don't get the backing money. Currently in Geektopio - feel like they acquired Garmin. Have a couple of billion in the bank, global distribution chain, etc. Feels like they can do anything.

Yearly workshops (non-corporate) to define the golden-thread: what do want to do and who do we want to be. This aligns the company to a clear vision. Very important to have fun, it is all about the journey. The exit is great, but reflecting reiterates it is about how you got there. Needs to be something you love, otherwise you are just wasting time.

**Tip for getting money:**\\
Valuation in EU is 3 ~ 4x more than SA and US is 3 ~ 4x more in the US. Try to build connections in the US for long term.

**Questions**\\
Surrounding yourself with good / quality people. Now that you are corporate, how do you keep those people?
Same answer as a year ago: all about ownership. People need to feel like they are part of the business, not about shares, but rather allowing people to take responsibility and give them authority to do things. Create an environment where they can flourish. Sincere focus on valuing people, keeping them happy on all levels: food, exercise, socializing.

What is the state of your team, Garmin, what happens post sale, is there a tie-in period?
Last week Garmin pimped out the office: new servers, laptops, new toys to play with. Need to manage boundaries, try to keep the culture intact, avoid the classic corporate culture where people take sick-leave because they "have it". Paying it forward, angel investing, trying to keep it real.

Why are SA exits kept under wraps when you read so much about overseas deals?
Acquirer dictates, all depends. Makes it easier for them to negotiate with the next company.

**[Mark Forrester](https://twitter.com/mark_forrester) from [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/) / [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/)

Frustrated with being a freelancer: holidays mean no money, hard to find constant contracts. 18 months before meeting the others in the company, only comms via non-verbal, didn't even know what everyone sounded like. Company had been registered, had some side-contracts still. Team is distributed across the world, one in Sau Paulo, one in Poland. Happiness hero lives in an RV, drives across the US drinking beer ... Started as support, but quickly moved into culture / on-boarding new staff. TheRoamingPint - tests craft beer in the US, drives to new city every week.

**People don't like to be micro-managed:**\\
How do you balance trusting people with expectations. (Head of support is full time fireman, sits in his truck with a laptop.)

Hire-by-trial, [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/). Do a paid, 1 ~ 2 project test as a start, then a panel interview. Team decides if they want to work with the person.

**2012 / 2013**\\
Changing partnerships. Founder leaving, feels like a divorce, no matter how nice you try to be. Went from CEO completely out, serial starter, wanted to build something new. Different decision making process, with 3 people, 2 agree. With 2, you can't get consensus easily.

**Advice:**\\
Focus on work/life balance. Has a 3year old, can work from home which is great. Need to still scale the company, but not at the expense of family.

[WordPress](http://wordpress.com) theme gold-rush is past, WooCommerce is a natural pivot as you can't build a business on $10 themes.

**Pros / Cons of open-sourcing something that makes you money and running a business on it:**\\
Normally surrounded by a huge community, provide the tools and own your data - you are not tied into a service provider, can change what / how you like. By being on the WordPress plugin repository, you aren't allowed to *call home* to see what your numbers are. Destructive when people take your themes at $10 a pop, sell the bundle at $5 and say "GPL, I am allowed to do this".

**Questions**\\
Things that make remote work difficult?
Set up payroll / different companies / paying international - lots of admin work that can make things difficult.

**[Slack](http://slack.com)! Organizational memory!!!**

React to hack by apologizing, fix it and full disclosure.

Changing from a $70, life-time support is like the Health and Racquet club. Cannot build sustainable business on that. People will get upset, especially if you initially had a GPL license. Allowed 2 years of grandfather, seeing a lot of license renewals now.

Post-lunch coma, very interesting talk, but no notes :)

**[Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) from [Parse](http://parse.com)**

Didn't grow up with computers at all, piano scholarship. Got a crush on a CS boy, lost interest in boy fast, but not computers. Took 2 years to go from piano to coding: really likes money, not performing or teaching, so rules out music until you are independently wealthy :)

[LindenLab](http://www.lindenlab.com) in 2002, saw Simple Life grow from 25 employees, 1 rack, to 10,000 machines and loads of employees after 5.5years. Ops to server ration had to stay under 1:1000. Reason for staying so long was that she worked on a meaningful product: people really enjoyed using SecondLife - they found their online "tribe". Company needs to be filled with people who love what they do and is aligned with what the company does. Dunbar number - about 140 people who can keep track of. If you start growing above this, you have the manager of managers of managers problems. Don't want to work with people who want to collect a paycheck.

Best hiring technique: do basic technical test, then put photos up on wall and throw a dart. Spending more time doesn't make the choice better. Loved Linden, lots of different roles / things to do. Wanted something new after 5.5 years, but with the same community feeling and that mattered. Went to eCommerce shop for 1 year, 1 day - what you praise are the patterns that will be reinforced. They praised engineers staying up till midnight and passing out on couches.

Went to another startup closer to home, but found it a bit boring, main reason for choosing was that it was easy. Next stop was an anti-scan company, nice product, but very bad with tech. Once again stayed for 1 year, 1 day. Then found Parse - first infrastructure engineer. The 12 software engineers had no idea how to hire an infrastructure engineer. Not sure why she was hired as she hadn't worked on any of the tech they had, but she had the expertise they were looking for: scaling up different tech stacks successfully. Your key skill is not a specific tech stack, but the ability to learn what you need to solve a given problem.

At Parse, fell in love with [Chef](https://www.chef.io/). Had to use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as there was nothing else that could handle what they did, even if it kept falling over. Scaling has grown at 5x every year - a lot of hires have come from Google. There is no point in designing a system that should scale more than 10x your current system: you will try to solve problems that you don't understand yet. The mindset should be that you will be rewriting again for the next 10x, make peace with that. First version used Ruby on Rails, current rewrite is in Go.

Acquired by [Facebook](https://facebook.com), and acquisitions are hard. Initial commute was 15mins on a bike, now it is ~3 hours per day on the shuttle. Culture clash: they have built a bigger platform, therefore feel that your problems are small and they can "easily" fix them. Going from walking into a room where you know everyone, know their skills and being able to joke to having to constantly prove yourself to a room full of new people. Main reason for staying is that a lot of the engineers that kept the backup running had left, so felt responsible to keep things going. Other engineers left as they came from Google, so felt there wasn't really any benefit, so went back to Google. Finally adapted to the Facebook culture, but still doesn't like the large corporate culture. Working with Mark to fix MongoDB has been amazing, probably won't be able to get that kind of experience anywhere else.

Likes the fact that Facebook have identified what makes startups and constantly tries to applies that - Google not so much. Startups rarely fails for moving too fast. "Move fast, but with stable infrastructure" - a lot of "that is someone else's problem". In the startup culture, you don't have that, something breaks, you fix it.

Raised in a very gender-role specific environment, didn't want any of that and therefore choose software dev. Didn't initially care about being the only woman in the room, later when there were more, it felt a bit weird. Linden Labs managed to have ~30% women, also a lot of gay / trans-gender people. Got comfortable working with lots of different people. Didn't notice the sexism, but you shouldn't have to ignore it. Most guys in tech are oblivious, not trying to keep women out - so when something comes up, point it out.

Distributed workplaces are hard: making them effective and feel included. Linden Labs was very good with this, primarily because their product was for distributed interactions. Need to fix it / implement it early, very very hard to fix it later.

**Questions**\\
Parse isn't very friendly / backward compatible for older phones, i.e. Africa market. What todo about that?
Very little - not the market they are focussed on.

Now that you know how to handle Mongo / other large tools, wouldn't you approach the acquisition the same way as Facebook?
FB now has a better, softer approach to on-boarding, they acknowledge that company is the expert on their product.

How to upgrade: API splitter, sent request to both Go and Ruby, compare the differences, logs them, but send the Ruby version back. That way you find the problems.

Everyone should start their own company and become part of a local network - you need an eco-system to be able to survive.
